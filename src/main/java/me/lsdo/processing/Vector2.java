/**
 * ( begin auto-generated from PVector2.xml )
 *
 * A class to describe a two or three dimensional vector. This datatype
 * stores two or three variables that are commonly used as a position,
 * velocity, and/or acceleration. Technically, <em>position</em> is a point
 * and <em>velocity</em> and <em>acceleration</em> are vectors, but this is
 * often simplified to consider all three as vectors. For example, if you
 * consider a rectangle moving across the screen, at any given instant it
 * has a position (the object's location, expressed as a point.), a
 * velocity (the rate at which the object's position changes per time unit,
 * expressed as a vector), and acceleration (the rate at which the object's
 * velocity changes per time unit, expressed as a vector). Since vectors
 * represent groupings of values, we cannot simply use traditional
 * addition/multiplication/etc. Instead, we'll need to do some "vector"
 * math, which is made easy by the methods inside the <b>PVector2</b>
 * class.
 *
 * The methods for this class are extensive. For a complete list, visit the
 * <a
 * href="http://processing.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/processing/build/javadoc/core/">developer's reference.</a>
 *
 * ( end auto-generated )
 *
 * A class to describe a two or three dimensional vector.
 * <p>
 * The result of all functions are applied to the vector itself, with the
 * exception of cross(), which returns a new PVector2 (or writes to a specified
 * 'target' PVector2). That is, add() will add the contents of one vector to
 * this one. Using add() with additional parameters allows you to put the
 * result into a new PVector2. Functions that act on multiple vectors also
 * include static versions. Because creating new objects can be computationally
 * expensive, most functions include an optional 'target' PVector2, so that a
 * new PVector2 object is not created with each operation.
 * <p>
 * Initially based on the Vector3D class by <a href="http://www.shiffman.net">Dan Shiffman</a>.
